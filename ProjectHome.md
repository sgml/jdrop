Jdrop provides a place to store JSON data up in the cloud. The initial application is for storing performance data gathered from mobile devices. It's hard to analyze large amounts of information (HTTP waterfall charts, HTTP headers, document source, etc.) on a mobile device. Jdrop lets you gather this data on the mobile device but analyze it remotely on a larger screen.
